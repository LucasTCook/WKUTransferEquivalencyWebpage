Project 1 Phase III ———— Lucas Cook

Web Server - Apache
Scripting - OO PHP
Front-End - JavaScript, HTML, JQuery


In this part of the project I continued to use in-line AWK scripts to scrape the course data from raw .txt files copied from the page’s source code. After I completed the scraping I extended my previous database to now include the following tables:



Schools
Courses
wkuCourses
Review



Schools(ID, Name, City, State)

- ID is a unique hashed value (Key)
- Name is the name of the school
- City is the city the school belongs to
- State is the State or Country in which the school is located



Courses(ID, SchoolID, Number, Title, Hours, Equivalent, Review)
 
- ID is a unique hashed value (Key)
- SchoolID is the ID of the school that the course belongs to (Foreign Key)
- Number is the abbreviation of the course
- Title is the full name of the course
- Hours is how many credit hours the course is worth at its belonging school
- Equivalent is the ID of the wkuCourse of which it is equivalent (Foreign Key)
- Review is the ID of the Review that was performed on this course (Foreign Key)



wkuCourses(ID, Number, Title, Hours, AndOr, GenEd, Colonnade)
 
- ID is a unique hashed value (Key)
- Number is the abbreviation of the course
- Title is the full name of the course
- Hours is the number of hours the course is worth at WKU
- AndOr is whether or not the course covers multiple courses
- GenEd is the General Education requirement that it fulfills
- Colonnade is the Colonnade General Education requirement that it fulfills



Review(ID, TransferCourse, WKUCourse, Status, TimeOfDecision, Comments)

- ID is a unique hashed value (Key)
- TransferCourse is the ID of the Course that is under review (Foreign Key)
- WKUCourse is the ID of the wkuCourse that is being reviewed to the above Course (Foreign Key) 
- Status is an integer that described the decision or current status of the review
	- 0 = Under Review / Not Yet Reviewed
	- (-1) = Declined Transfer Equivalency
	- 1 Approved Transfer Equivalency
- TimeOfDecision is a timestamp in EPOCH time that the Status was changed
- Comments is a string of any of the reviewer’s comments

(It is also possible to add the reviewers ID to a “Reviewer” column if that was available to us)



Using Object Oriented PHP makes dealing with the database very simple since every row is just an object. With proper normalization of data across each table I was able to pull all of the linked information I needed to complete the project. Contained in this .zip is a copy of my source code. The object files show exactly how my database is set up.
